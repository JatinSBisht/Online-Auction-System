# Online-Auction-System
Project Overview
This project involves building a full-fledged online auction platform where users can bid on items, see real-time updates, and participate in live auctions.
The system would allow users to create accounts, browse items up for auction, place bids, and manage their bids.
# Key Features of the Online Auction System \n
User Registration & Authentication:
Users must be able to register, log in, and maintain an account.
Item Listings:
Sellers can list items they wish to auction, including images, descriptions, and auction start/end times.
Real-Time Bidding:
Users can place bids on items in real-time.
Real-Time Auction Countdown: 
The system displays a countdown until the auction ends.
Notification System:
Users receive notifications when they win or lose an auction, or when they are outbid.
Admin Panel:
Admins can manage items, users, and auction details.
Payment Integration:
Once an auction ends, the winning user is directed to a payment gateway to complete the purchase.
# Technologies to Use
# Frontend:
React.js: For building the user interface.
Redux (optional): For state management (if needed).
Socket.IO: To provide real-time updates for the bidding process.
Material UI/Bootstrap: For UI components.
React Router: To handle routing between different pages (auction listings, user profile, etc.).
Axios or Fetch API: For making API calls to the backend.
# Backend:
Node.js with Express.js: For building the server and API routes.
Socket.IO: To handle real-time communication between users and the server (for the bidding process).
MongoDB: For storing user data, auction items, and bids (NoSQL database).
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For user authentication.
Bcrypt.js: For securely hashing user passwords.
Mongoose: To interact with MongoDB using an object data modeling (ODM) library.
Real-time Technologies:
Socket.IO: Used to broadcast updates on the bidding process to all users who are currently viewing the auction. When one user places a bid, others should instantly see the new highest bid.
Payment Integration (optional for advanced feature):
Stripe or PayPal: For payment processing when an auction ends
